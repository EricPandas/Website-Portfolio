  <p><left>My name is Eric Amoah, I am 16 years old, and I am a Sophomore in Epic Academy.
    My hobbies are reading, working out, mobile gaming, watching tv and listening to music.
    I like learning about things that interest me, for example technology.</left></p>

  <h2><left>What got me into coding?</left></h2>
  <p style="font-size:20px"
  <p style="font-family:Lucida Sans"
  <p>I'd say I got into coding because of a website known as <a href=https://code.org/>code.org</code></a> 
  I started learning more about coding during middle school, where I took an after school program in
coding. I found the program relatively easy to what I'm doing now. All I had to do was give a couple
of commands to Minecraft Steve, to lead him to his destination. This made me feel powerful, I felt
I was god and that I could make steve do whatever I wanted. At that point I took an interest in coding.<p>

<h2><left><b>Where do I want to be in the future?</b></left></h2>
<p style="font-size:20px"
<p style="font-family:Lucida Sans"
<p>I want to be the type of person who is making a difference to others, while in a comfortable environment,
  while get paid a good amount of money. So I decided I would be a Software engineer since it fits into
  all of those criterias.
